# Implementation Tasks

## 1. Configure Vite for GitHub Pages
- [x] 1.1 Update `vite.config.ts` to add `base: '/ben/'` configuration for production builds
- [x] 1.2 Verify that development mode still works correctly without base path
- [x] 1.3 Test local production build with `npm run build && npm run preview` to verify base path

## 2. Create GitHub Actions Deployment Workflow
- [x] 2.1 Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` with Node.js setup (version from package.json engines)
- [x] 2.2 Configure workflow with manual trigger (workflow_dispatch)
- [x] 2.3 Add build step with `npm ci` and `npm run build`
- [x] 2.4 Add deployment step using `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v4` or equivalent to push to gh-pages branch
- [x] 2.5 Configure GitHub Pages permissions in workflow (write permissions for contents and pages)
- [x] 2.6 Add build artifact validation to check dist folder contents

## 3. Update Documentation
- [x] 3.1 Add deployment section to `README.md` with workflow trigger instructions
- [x] 3.2 Document required GitHub repository settings (Pages enabled, gh-pages branch source)
- [x] 3.3 Add troubleshooting guide for common deployment issues
- [x] 3.4 Include verification steps to confirm successful deployment

## 4. Configure GitHub Repository
- [ ] 4.1 Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings
- [ ] 4.2 Configure Pages to deploy from gh-pages branch
- [ ] 4.3 Verify GitHub Actions has write permissions for repository

## 5. Testing and Validation
- [ ] 5.1 Trigger workflow manually and verify successful build
- [ ] 5.2 Verify gh-pages branch is created/updated with build output
- [ ] 5.3 Access https://yhattm.github.io/ben and verify site loads correctly
- [ ] 5.4 Verify all assets (CSS, JS, images) load with correct paths
- [ ] 5.5 Test navigation and routing work correctly with base path
- [ ] 5.6 Run end-to-end tests against deployed site if applicable

## 6. Finalization
- [x] 6.1 Create commit with deployment configuration
- [ ] 6.2 Update this tasks.md to mark all items complete
- [ ] 6.3 Prepare for archival when deployment is verified in production
